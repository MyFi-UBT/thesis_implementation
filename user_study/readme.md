## About
This folder contains the results of the user study conducted to evaluate the intuitive usability of process task annotations. The content is published in [1].

## Description
The findings are partitioned into descriptive and statistical analyses.
The descriptive outcomes are documented in an xlsx file ("Deskriptive_Auswertung.xlsx"), encompassing the dataset, calculations, and associated figures derived from it.
The statistical results are encapsulated in an HTML file ("Skript-Intuivitaet.html"), generated through the R project located in the same subfolder.

## Note
Kindly be advised that the content is exclusively available in German. However, a summary of the study findings in English can be found in [1].

## Acknowledgements
We want to thank Matthias Sehlbrede for supporting the statistical analysis with R.
